# escape-from-the-maze

This code block is written to design a maze and try to escape from the maze using the most well-known method. 

First, a maze of size 12x12 is created, and then an attempt is made to escape from the maze. Due to the randomness of the maze, it may not always be possible to escape from the maze. In this case, either the start location is returned to or the code remains unsuccessful.

Every step are shown on the screen and the end result is stated.
